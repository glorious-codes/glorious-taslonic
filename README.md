# [WIP] Taslonic
> A glorious UI library built on top of native custom elements

## Early definitions

1. Taslonic aims to be an easy to use UI library on top of the latest advances of Web Components specification.
2. The master goal is delivering a set of components that can be used for any SPA framework/library.
3. Different from famous libraries like Bootstrap, we'll focus on very few components. Although few in quantity, we're going to tackle components that have a lot of potencial to save development time like forms and data-grids.

## Suggested set of components

- row
- col
- loader
- alert
- button
- input
- email input
- field
- form
- data-grid
